Readme File for AWB Population By Race & Ethnicity More Info Generator
Written in Python 3.8 (download Python 3.8 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)

This script will need to be updated when Census 2021 data is released. It is currently augmented to accommodate
missing Census 2020 data due to covid. The script is outputting 2019 data for the 1-Year Estimates and includes
a note in the output to communicate that to our users. There are TODO notes included in the MoreInfo.py file
which indicate the few places where the code will need to be changed to go back to current year data instead of
(current year - 1) data.

If the formatting or order of our original file has changed this script was created it will still work and it
should still be in the correct order.

Usage instructions:
===================
- Download the AWB Population By Race & Ethnicity file from our site.
- Save it as .csv in the same location as the MoreInfo.py script
- Run MoreInfo.py
- A new file named outputfile.txt will be created in the same directory
- In this file is the html code which can be pasted directly into the more info page on our admin site
- Make sure you are pasting the html code from outputfile.txt into the textbox after clicking SOURCE so you
should be overwriting html code instead of the normal formatted text.

Statistical Significance Usage:
===================
Inside the statistical significance folder there is another python script that will output the same html code, but additionally it will output the statistical significance testing results. The data for this indicator is in percentage form and doesn't contain total population data for each location so the only proper way to get statistics significance testing is manually. This is easily done by pulling the estimates from the same Census source and use of this existing statistical significance testing tool from the Census as well (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/statistical-testing-tool). Follow the next steps to process this output from the tool into a new input .csv:
- Take the output column from the census tool (Yes/No) and paste into new columns in our new input .csv
- These columns should be named for the year they are comparing to for example, if we want to show that 2020 was a statistically significant change from 2019, we would label the column StatSig2019 as it is always comparing with the newest data year.
- Run MoreInfoStatSig.py and examine the statsigoutput.txt file which should now be filled with html text including lines indicating a statistically significant change or not.
