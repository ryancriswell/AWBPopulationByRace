Readme File for AWB Population By Race & Ethnicity More Info Generator
Written in Python 3.8 (download Python 3.8 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)

This script will need to be updated when Census 2021 data is released. It is currently augmented to accommodate
missing Census 2020 data due to covid. The script is outputting 2019 data for the 1-Year Estimates and includes
a note in the output to communicate that to our users. There are TODO notes included in the MoreInfo.py file
which indicate the few places where the code will need to be changed to go back to current year data instead of
current year - 1 data.

If the formatting or order of our original file has changed this script was created it will still work and it
should still be in the correct order.

Usage instructions:
===================
- Download the AWB Population By Race & Ethnicity file from our site.
- Save it as .csv in the same location as the MoreInfo.py script
- Run MoreInfo.py
- A new file named outputfile.txt will be created in the same directory
- In this file is the html code which can be pasted directly into the more info page on our admin site
- Make sure you are pasting the html code from outputfile.txt into the textbox after clicking SOURCE so you
should be overwriting html code instead of the normal formatted text.
